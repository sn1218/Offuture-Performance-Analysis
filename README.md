# Offuture Performance Analysis
## Overview

Offuture is a global online store specializing in office furniture, technology, and office supplies. Since its launch in 2010, Offuture has delivered high-quality products worldwide. In 2020, the company engaged a consulting firm to analyze their sales data and build predictive models. However, due to inaccuracies in the consultant’s final presentation, Offuture’s CEO, Hamish Boxworth, lost trust in the consultancy’s findings.

To restore confidence, Offuture has approached our Data Science firm to conduct a proof of concept. This project focuses on Descriptive Analytics for Offuture’s historical sales data from 2011 to 2015. The goal is to provide accurate and reliable insights into their performance during this period.

Offuture is not asking any specific questions but expects a comprehensive analysis of their sales, profit, and other key performance metrics to demonstrate our capability before moving to more predictive tasks.

## Objectives

This project aims to deliver an accurate, data-driven analysis of Offuture’s sales performance from 2011 to 2015. Tasks include:

* Analysing historical sales data to reveal key business insights.
* Presenting accurate statistics on orders, revenue, and profit.
* Identifying best- and worst-performing products.
* Conducting a detailed market analysis focusing on key regions (APAC and EU).
* Exploring factors that drive profitability, such as product categories, shipping modes, and customer behavior.

## The Project
